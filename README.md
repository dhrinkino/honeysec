# HoneySEC

**HoneySec** is a project of interconnected honeypot systems that collects and processes information about login attempts.  
The output consists of aggregated lists of IP addresses that attempted unauthorized access to our infrastructure.

## Categories

| Dataset   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ip_all** | Contains all IP addresses that have logged into any of our honeypots at least once. |
| **ip_2**   | Contains IP addresses that logged into a honeypot at least 2 times. This filter helps eliminate false positives, typos, or one-off scanning attempts. (**recommended for most use cases**) |
| **ip_5**   | Contains IP addresses that logged into a honeypot at least 5 times. This dataset is suitable for analysis in environments with limited resources or when working only with the most reliable data. |

## Versions

| Dataset     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **raw**     | Plain list of IP addresses, one per line. |
| **cidr**    | List of IP addresses with a `/32` prefix, one per line. |
| **ipset**   | Configuration in `ipset` command format, adding addresses to the **honeysec** list. |
| **mikrotik**| Ready-to-use commands for Mikrotik RouterOS 7+, creating an `address-list` named **honeysec**. |
